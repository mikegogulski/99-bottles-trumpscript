$$ TrumpScript is a language based upon the illustrious Donald Trump. It   $$
$$ has any number of app{ea,al}ling misfeatures, including a lack of       $$
$$ functions, a syntax that will make you want to claw your eyes out, and  $$
$$ no type conversions. While TrumpScript is Turing-complete, it's dumber  $$
$$ than a box of hair and apt to cause raging violence in anyone who       $$
$$ attempts to make it do anything useful at all -- perhaps like some      $$
$$ people you know. The compiler is implemented in Python.                 $$
$$                                                                         $$
$$ This implementation of 99 Bottles in TrumpScript aims to be both as     $$
$$ complete as possible and relatively readable. It is non-conformant      $$
$$ with the lyrics spec in that it seems impossible to print both an       $$
$$ integer and a string on the same line. Its inanity could be vastly      $$
$$ enhanced by randomly replacing the identifiers used with others from    $$
$$ TrumpScript's allowed_words.py, by inserting any number of words and    $$
$$ phrases the loathsome compiler will ignore, or by attempting to make it $$
$$ as concise as possible. No attempt whatsoever at rhetorical greatness   $$
$$ (or even national greatness) has been made here.                        $$
$$                                                                         $$
